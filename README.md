# objective

Have you ever tried to decide whether or not to buy something on impulse? Have you ever thought of a purchase in terms of some other "currency"? Objective is just that--a way of seeing money as something you buy often, such as coffee or even beer. Keep track of your saving goals in terms of this objective, and make easy decisions by converting between "real currency" and your own internal currency. The "Sleep on it" function allows you to take a picture of a possible purchase and be asked again at a later date about whether or not you want to buy it.
